                    <p>The Red Fort, also known as Lal Qila, is one of the most significant and iconic monuments of India, located in the heart of Old Delhi. Built by the Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan in 1639 when he decided to shift his capital from Agra to Delhi, the fort served as the main residence of the Mughal emperors for nearly 200 years. Its construction was completed in 1648, and it stands as a prime example of Mughal architecture, combining Persian, Timurid, and Indian influences into a majestic blend of elegance and strength. The fort gets its name from the massive red sandstone walls that surround it, stretching over 2.5 kilometers in circumference and reaching up to 33 meters in height. The Red Fort was not just a palace; it was a complete city with apartments, halls, mosques, gardens, offices, workshops, and audience chambers. It represents the zenith of Mughal creativity and planning. The fort complex includes some of the most beautiful structures such as the Diwan-i-Aam (Hall of Public Audience), where the emperor would meet with the general public and address their concerns, and the Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience), an ornate chamber where the emperor would meet with special guests and dignitaries. The Diwan-i-Khas once housed the legendary Peacock Throne inlaid with precious gems, including the famous Koh-i-Noor diamond. Other important buildings include the Rang Mahal (Palace of Colors), which served as a residence for royal women and was decorated with beautiful mirror work, and the Mumtaz Mahal, which now houses a museum showcasing Mughal artifacts. The fort is surrounded by lush gardens laid out in the Charbagh style, with canals and fountains that reflect the sophistication of Mughal landscaping.</p>
